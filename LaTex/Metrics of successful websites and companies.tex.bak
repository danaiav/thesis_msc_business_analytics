\section{Introduction}
 
An on-line presence of a company was not an important factor of its success until a few years ago. Taking although into account the vast spread of the impact that internet has on consumers regarding their choices this hypothesis is not valid any more. Companies are obliged by the trends to be active on-line and to maintain a website that depicts the image they want their consumers to perceive. The purpose of this paper is to understand the relationship that exists between the website of a company and its success. Trying to comprehend this relationship a comparison will take place between specific metrics of the websites of the Fortune's 500 more successful companies  and their financial status. By performing regression models and statistical analysis this paper will try to explore which metrics of a company's website influence its success.

\section{Data gathering}
The first step in order to contact this research is to conclude to the companies that are going to be examined. Since the purpose of this paper is to see if the website metrics that will be examined are influencing the success of the company it is a good idea to examine websites of some already successful companies and try to find out what they have in common.

\subsection{Data Source - Fortune 500}
The Fortune 500 is an annual list compiled and published by Fortune magazine that ranks 500 of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue for their respective fiscal years. The list includes public companies, along with privately held companies for which revenues are publicly available.\cite{key1, key2}\\ 
For the purposes of this paper we will use this list of companies and we will examine their websites in order to understand if they indeed have something in common or if their success is irrelevant with their on-line presence.\\
The first thing that we will need is a list of the names that are include in the fortune 500. The easiest way to obtain this list is from the following article:
\href{url}{http://www.zyxware.com/articles/4344/list-of-fortune-500-companies-and-their-websites}.\ The way that we will obtain the list will be explained in the 2.4 Scripts section of this chapter.
The companies that are included in the Fortune 500 during the period this paper is taking place are the following ones\cite{key3}:

\subsection{Metrics}
Now that we have declared the companies that we are going to use we will also need to decide which metrics are we going to examine for each site.
