\section{Introduction}
 
An on-line presence of a company was not an important factor of its success until a few years ago. Taking although into account the vast spread of the impact that internet has on consumers regarding their choices this hypothesis is not valid any more. Companies are obliged by the trends to be active on-line and to maintain a website that depicts the image they want their consumers to perceive. The purpose of this paper is to understand the relationship that exists between the website of a company and its success. Trying to comprehend this relationship a comparison will take place between specific metrics of the websites of the Fortune's 500 more successful companies  and their financial status. By performing regression models and statistical analysis this paper will try to explore which metrics of a company's website influence its success.
